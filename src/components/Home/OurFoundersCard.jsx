          Fadas Travel was founded by Makbule and Seckin, a couple who have
          lived all over the world and worked in industries outside of tourism.
          After restoring their hotel in Cappadocia and starting Fadas Travel,
          they fell in love with the work. Today, they are living in Turkey and
          are dedicated to showing people how special their homeland is.
